> Task source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy

## File explanation
1. `m5-forecast-with-lgbm_yuga.ipynb`: Tree-based method using LGBM
2. `m5-forecast-with-simple-lstm_yuga.ipynb`: Neural network method using LSTM
3. `M5-Forecasting-EDA_yuga.ipynb`: basic exploratary data analysis (exploring dat to understand the landscape of data)

## Future work
1. Apply Attention mechanism to NN
2. Execute more feature engineering methods
